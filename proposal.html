        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Choosing a college is a big decision, and it may even affect a students’ future academic success.
            For students who is applying to college, picking schools they want to apply to is always painful.
            There are many factors that may affect students’ decision, such as application fee, different kinds
            of college rankings, financial aid, acceptance rate and location. For each individual student,
            looking for specific information about one college is probably not that hard, however, it is
            hard for students to explore colleges that meet their own criteria and have an overview of what
            are some potential schools they may consider applying to since there is merely college application
            website that provides integrated information about colleges and has filtering functionalities.
            The inefficient way of collecting college information by searching college information one by
            one is making the application experience worse, and even causes students overlook some potential colleges.
            However, a web application with filtering functionality and integrated data can make this problem much
            better.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are already some existing attempts for solving this problem. For example, the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/search?school-name=&amp;location=">
                "best colleges" section of US News</a> provides quite integrated information about college and
            universities and allow users to filter
            out
            schools based on their information such as location, ranking, tuition and acceptance rate. However, this
            web application only refers US News ranking. There are much more authoritative college rankings such as
            Times Higher Education, QS and, and Academic Ranking of World Universities. Each ranking has their own
            algorithm of ranking. That means if we only look at US News ranking, we may make one-sided decision. It
            will be more reasonable to give user to choose which ranking they wish to apply on filtering. <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/search-colleges">The
                Common
                application</a> website also has a searching and filtering functionality to explore colleges and
            universities.
            However, their information seems not as integrated as US News and users doesn’t have much choice to filter.

        <h2>App Functionality</h2>
        <p>

            from their current school or students who is considering transfer to another college will be accessing my

            are on in explore page, they can select to choose which institution’s ranking they want to use. Then they
            either type in textbox about schools’ name, or choose to filter by selecting state, public/private,
            religion/none religion and adjust range such as bar about tuition, admission rate, population size. Then
            user can click on “search” button. Besides that, if user only cares about ranking, they can choose the
            ranking they care about and click on the “search” button. After that, on the right side of the page, it
            will show all the schools that meet criteria. Clicking on the school you like, it shows specific
            information about this school, including the different kinds of ranking. User can click on “add to my
            collection” to save, and saved colleges information will be available at “Account” tab. User can also rate
            schools and leave comments base on their impressions.
        </p>
        <h3>General Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the Sign In/Up Tab</li>
                <li>Input user information to sign up</li>
                <li>Click on "Explore" Tab</li>
                <li>Select features and adjust value bar or simply type in school name in textbox</li>
                <li>Click on "Search" button</li>
                <li>Click on school you want to check</li>
                <li>(Optional) Rate the school, leave comment, and add it to "Collection" by clicking on the
                    corresponding button and writing in textbox </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            This solution will not only help to filter and obtain integrate college information, but also provide
            information from multiple authorities. Because of the filter feature, student do not have to search school
            information one by one. They can simply tell the application the features of their preferred schools, which
            makes the application searching process much more convenient. The “Collection” feature can also make the
            application more organized.
